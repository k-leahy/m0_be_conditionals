# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
# I feel confident in the comparison operators.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
# I feel once I get the input codes down I will be more confident in the logical operators. I am searching for how to input the equation into ruby. As far as figuring out the logical problem I am much more confident.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
# I again feel pretty confident in the if statement.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
# I honestly don't know how much time I spent on this but if I had to guess probably around 1.5 hours because I was looking for how to create what I needed to happen on the challenge questions. Also I usually film a couple times but it is definitely getting better.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
# I need to learn the different ways to input in Ruby such as getting an even or odd. I felt the second challenge was easier for me. I am going to try and research more on my own and practice to get this down.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
# I'm still trying to figure out challenge #3 so first I will try and research if I can't figure it out I will either ask a classmate or teacher.
